I am a Machine Learning Research Lead at Vayve Technologies India Pvt Ltd.  

Before this, I worked as Lead Software Engineer developing end to end systems that involved large scale IoT solutions.
I received my B.Tech (2016) in Electronics and Electrical Engineering from IIT Guwahati.

### Research

Machine Learning. I am interested in the areas of Optimization, Domain Adaptation and Deep Learning. In particular, frameworks that
have strong theoritical foundations in above areas. Recent focuses include Optimal Transport, Riemannian Optimization.

### Industrial Experience

**A Real-Time solution for TV Viewership collection and processing across India.**  
*Lead Software Engineer*  

TV Viewership information is necessary in generating the TRP index. An IoT solution with population based sampling for such collection of information is the standard way. Systems that can do this collection and processing in *real-time* enhance the ability to quickly generalize this sampling of Viewership information. We designed and developed a system (involving multitude of components) to meet this real-time criteria, supporting upto a *million* of such Viewership collection nodes.
Our system is currently deployed across India (under the Broadcast and Research Council (*BARC*) body) and is serving as a means for country's TRP measurement system.  

*HONOR*: Received a certificate of appreciation from BARC for the developed system.
