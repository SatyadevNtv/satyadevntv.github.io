**A Real-Time solution for TV Viewership collection and processing across India.**  
*Lead Software Engineer*  

TV Viewership information is necessary in generating the TRP index. A large scale IoT solution with population based sampling for collecting this information is the standard way. Generalizing this sampled data quickly, depends directly on the latency and throughput across these IoT nodes, which is the core challenge (among many others) in these large scale distributed systems. We designed and developed a system (involving multitude of components) that can do this in real-time, supporting upto a *million* of such Viewership collection nodes.
Our system is currently deployed across India (under the Broadcast and Research Council (*BARC*) body) and is serving as a means for country's TRP measurement system.  

*HONOR*: Received a certificate of appreciation from BARC for the developed system.
