Technical Lead - Machine Learning, Teachmint Technologies, India.  

Prior to this, I worked on design and development of systems involving large scale IoT solutions.  
I received my B.Tech (2016) in Electronics and Electrical Engineering from IIT Guwahati.

## Research

Machine Learning. I am interested in the areas of Optimization, Domain Adaptation and Deep Learning. In particular, I work on 
frameworks that have/provide strong theoretical foundations in above areas. Recent focuses include Optimal Transport, 
Riemannian Optimization.
